Deductive Logic:

In deductive logic, conclusions are derived from premises with absolute certainty. Here's a representation:

Premise 1: Proactive controls aim to prevent or mitigate hazardous events.
Premise 2: "No payment" is a hazardous event.
Premise 3: Credit checks, payment terms, advance payments, and invoice verification are measures that can prevent "no payment."
Conclusion: Therefore, proactive controls for the hazardous event of "no payment" include credit checks, payment terms, advance payments, and invoice verification.

Inductive Logic:

In inductive logic, conclusions are drawn based on patterns or observations. Here's a representation:

Observation 1: Organizations that implement credit checks, payment terms, advance payments, and invoice verification tend to experience fewer instances of "no payment."
Observation 2: These measures are commonly recommended as best practices for risk mitigation.
Inductive Conclusion: Therefore, it can be inferred that proactive controls for the hazardous event of "no payment" include credit checks, payment terms, advance payments, and invoice verification.

Abductive Logic:

In abductive logic, conclusions are drawn based on the best explanation for observed evidence. Here's a representation:

Observation: Organizations that employ credit checks, payment terms, advance payments, and invoice verification are often successful in preventing "no payment" incidents.
Abductive Explanation: The best explanation for this observed success is that these measures are indeed proactive controls for preventing "no payment."

Abductive logic suggests that the selected controls are the best explanation for observed outcomes, given the context and evidence available.
