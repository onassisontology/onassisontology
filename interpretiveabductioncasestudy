Deductive Logic:

In deductive logic, conclusions are drawn based on established premises or known facts. Here, the answer follows deductively from the basic principles of arithmetic:

Premise 1: 2 is a number.
Premise 2: Addition is a mathematical operation.
Premise 3: When you add 2 to 2 using the addition operation, the result is determined mathematically.
Conclusion: Therefore, 2+2 is 4.

Inductive Logic:

In inductive logic, conclusions are drawn based on patterns or observations. Here, the answer can be represented as an inductive inference based on repeated observations:

Observation 1: When you add 2 to 2 multiple times, the result is consistently 4.
Observation 2: This pattern holds true in all instances we've observed.
Inductive Conclusion: Therefore, it is likely that 2+2 is 4 in all cases.

Abductive Logic:

In abductive logic, conclusions are drawn based on the best explanation for observed evidence. Here, the answer can be represented as an abductive inference:

Observation: When we perform the addition operation with 2 and 2, we consistently obtain the result 4.
Abductive Explanation: The best explanation for this consistent result is that 2+2 is indeed 4.

Abductive logic does not necessarily prove the answer but offers the most plausible explanation based on the available evidence.
